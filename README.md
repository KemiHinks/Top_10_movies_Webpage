TOP 10 MOVIES WEBPAGE USING FLASK, WTForms, SQLite, SQLAchemy, REST API's

1) Created and SQLite database with SQLAchemy. This should feature a movie table with my own chosen fields.
2) Looped through each entry and displayed it on the website homepage
3) Used WTForms to enable editing the movies displayed on the homepage and updated my database with these changes
4) Added an option that allows the user to add a movie
5) Using API's from https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-GB, i searched for matches between the movie title added by the user and movie titles on their database and returned all matches   to my webpages as clickeable options for the user
6) I used the API to also grab the movies image, year and description which is saved and generated one the movie is added.
