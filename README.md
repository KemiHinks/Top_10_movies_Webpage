# TOP 10 MOVIES WEBPAGE 

<hr style="border: 1px solid black;">

# **Introduction**

When asked about your favorite movies, it's easy to draw a blank and forget a few classics you love. This project involves creating a webpage where you can rate and review the movies you've watched, helping you curate your very own Top 10 list.

# **Objectives:**  
1) Create an SQLite database with SQLAchemy. This should feature a movie table with my own chosen fields.
2) Loop through each entry and displayed it on the website homepage.
3) Use WTForms to enable input and editing of movies and ratings displayed on the homepage.
5) Add an option that allows the user to add a movie.
6) Using APIs from The Movie Database (TMDb), the webpage searches for matches based on the user's movie title input and displays all relevant results as clickable options.
7) Use the API to  grab the movies thumbnail image, year and description which is saved and generated once the movie is added.  
8) The Top 10 list should automatically adjust to reflect changes in user-submitted ratings.
